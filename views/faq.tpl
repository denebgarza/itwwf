<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>How does this application work?</h2>
There's no magic to it. Every time you use this application your friends list is saved. On your 
next visit, your saved (old) friends list will be compared to your current one. Events such as 
friend deletions, account de-activations, etc. can be derived from this comparison.<br />
The actual process is a little more complex, but not by much...
<h2>Why can't I see any history from before I started using this application?</h2>
Due to the nature of how this app. works (see above), knowing your friend activity from 
before your first visit is technically impossible.
<h2>How accurate are the displayed times?</h2>
It depends on how frequently you use the application. The app. doesn't run all the time. It only runs when ever you use it. 
Therefore the timings on your friend's activity actually represent when you first found out about it, 
not necessarily when it actually happened.<br />
So the more often you use it, the more accurate the time-stamps will be.
<h2>How accurate are the results?</h2>
For the most part, they're accurate. An example of an inaccurate result would be someone blocking you 
from Facebook, which would appear to you as a deactivation. There might be more inaccuracies we're
not aware of. This app. doesn't claim to be 100% accurate, and as with everything in life, you should always 
take the results with a grain of salt.<br /><br />However, we do guarantee never to intentionally 
provide fake results.
